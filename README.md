## Deprecation note

This repository has been deprecated and is currently unmaintained. You can find up-to-date examples for building GraphQL servers with a database [here](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/).

## Features

- **Rapid scaffolding**: Simply use `graphql create` (from the [GraphQL CLI](https://github.com/graphql-cli/graphql-cli)) to download the boilerplate you want.
- **Easily extensible**: A boilerplate only provides the minimum setup so you can tailor the API to your use case.
- **Best practices**: Each boilerplate incorporates best practices from the GraphQL community.

Read more about the idea behind GraphQL boilerplates [here](https://blog.graph.cool/graphql-boilerplates-graphql-create-how-to-setup-a-graphql-project-6428be2f3a5).

## Quickstart

Select a boilerplate and follow the instructions in the belonging README to get started:

- `minimal` (_coming soon_): Minimal boilerplate with basic "Hello World" functionality
- [`basic`](./basic): Basic boilerplate based on a simple data model and with a GraphQL database
- [`advanced`](./advanced): Advanced boilerplate with a GraphQL database, authentication and realtime subscriptions

All projects are based on [`graphql-yoga`](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-yoga/), a fully-featured GraphQL server library with focus on easy setup, performance & great developer experience.

## Contributing

The GraphQL boilerplates are maintained by the GraphQL community, with official support from the [Apollo](https://dev-blog.apollodata.com) & [Graphcool](https://blog.graph.cool/) teams.
